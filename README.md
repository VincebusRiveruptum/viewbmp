# VIEWBMP
Simple BMP file viewer using VGA Mode 13h

Along with the previus Tetris app i wrote before i was also testing VGA        
graphics modes but specifically mode 13h and Mode X. This mode allows a 320x200 
resolution and 256 colors, it was widely used during the DOS era and the 
majority of games used this mode.

This small program does just what it's name says, display bitmap files by
command line. 

To getting it work, just compile BMP.C with Turbo C or Borland C on any 
emulator, i used Dosbox. The command line is bmp.exe "filename" without 
quotes.
